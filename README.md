# Monitor Calibration Tool

A simple web-based tool for calibrating multiple monitors using your MacBook's display as a reference.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` on your MacBook's display
2. Open the same page on each external monitor you want to calibrate
3. Use your MacBook's display as the reference (since it's factory calibrated)
4. Use the various test patterns to adjust your external monitor settings:

### Available Tests

- **Solid Colors**: Full screen color display for checking color accuracy and screen uniformity
- **Gradient Test**: Black to white gradient for checking smooth color transitions
- **Color Blocks**: Multiple color patches for comparing color reproduction
- **Text Sharpness**: Various text sizes and contrasts for checking text clarity

### Tips for Calibration

1. Start with brightness and contrast
   - Use the solid white and black tests
   - Adjust until you can see details in both bright and dark areas

2. Color accuracy
   - Use the solid color tests to match primary colors
   - The color blocks test helps verify overall color reproduction

3. Fine-tuning
   - Use the gradient test to check for smooth transitions
   - Use the text test to ensure text is sharp and clear

## Notes

- The control panel will fade when not in use (hover to show it)
- For best results, calibrate in a room with consistent lighting
- Take your time to match colors as closely as possible
